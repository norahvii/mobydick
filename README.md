## Closing remarks:

I've never created anything with a GUI before. So this was an adventure. Much of PySimpleGUI was definitely simple, but [this link](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/issues/907) is what helped marry my pre-UI code to the script I wrote previously. Also I was able to fix my regular expression problem.
